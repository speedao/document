# What is EVM-compatible Chain?

&#x20;**In 2021, more than $6 trillion of transactions settled on the Ethereum network, supporting the vigorous development of blockchain applications such as DeFi, NFT, and GameFi. But because Ethereum can only process about 15 transactions per second, the surge demand of transaction caused congestion on Ethereum network and high transaction fees.**

&#x20; **As a result, some developers begun to build new blockchains with lower transaction fees and faster settlement speed. And they provide EVM-compatible features to meet the needs of the Ethereum ecosystem and attract new users. These blockchains can be called EVM-compatible chain.**

&#x20; **EVM: It is the abbreviation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. The connection of EVM and Ethereum is just like CPU to computer. The EVM allows code to be verified and executed on the blockchain, providing assurance that the code will run the same way on every device.**

&#x20; **The EVM-compatible chain provides EVM-like execution environment for coding , making it easy for Ethereum developers to migrate smart contracts to the compatible chain without having to write smart contract code from scratch.**

&#x20; **Mainstream EVM-compatible chains include BSC, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon, etc.**
