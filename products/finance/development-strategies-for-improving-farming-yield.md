# Development Strategies for improving Farming yield

DEXs under the VeToKen model maintain good vitality, such as [Curve](https://curve.fi/) and [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/stake#/). By staking the corresponding tokens, the rewards for improving farm yield can be maximized. Pancake recently released the [pancake](https://pancakeswap.finance/) 2.0 white paper, and made a proposal plan for the reform of the existing economic model to VeToKen. In the foreseeable future, there seem to be high probability that more DEXs on new public chains will migrate the existing economic model to VeToKen.

SpeeDao can accumulate VeToKen (such as veJOE/bCAKE, etc.) which based on farm rewards on the DEX by means of emission incentives , therefore maximizing APY of the farm pool.
