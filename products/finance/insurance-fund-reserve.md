# Insurance fund reserve

All underlying pools provided by finance are filtered based on a set of screening models, which provide the first layer of security assurance；through cooperation with insurance projects, the stream payment policy pool bought by finance provides the second layer of security assurance. Moreover, we believe that the safety of users' funds is the bottom line for the healthy development of the industry. We have decided to establish a user funds safety reserve fund to deal with potential ＇black swan'in the future and make up for user losses that may occur. The fund accounts for 20% of the total Token. We hope that in the future it will realize multi-management model of development team + institution + community representative through community voting.
