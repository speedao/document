&#x20;  **Inspired by pancake. The NFT Pool provides new ways to acquire users and create new utility for NFT holders. In a real sense, the NFT Pool bring NFTs into the DeFi’s world. The NFT Pool is a decentralized model that allows users to create pools and allow users to search for pools through contracts. The page display will use weakly centralized logic to protect users from fraud risks.**
