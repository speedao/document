# SDK

In the process of participating in NFT, we find that many new crypto users know little about DeFi but are full of interest in learning. We firmly believe that NFT and DeFi will eventually merge.

We will cooperate with NFT's trading platform to promote the adoption of our SDK services by all DEX, which not only provides new value-added services for the NFT of crypto users, but also gives DEX a new way to utilise NFT while acquiring new users.

By adopting our open -sourcing SDK, the new public chain DEX can provide users with the staking function of blue-chip NFT as a plug-in for increasing farm output. While acquiring high-quality NFT holders, we will jointly promote the integration of NFT and DeFi.
