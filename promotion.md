# Community Promotion Mechanism

We attach great importance to markets of countries with low interest rates, such as: Turkey, Vietnam, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, etc. In order to promote the growth of the market in these countries, we will use incentive mechanisms such as referral relationships, community nodes, city nodes and committee promotion paths to stimulate growth.
