# What is the Scout Community?

&#x20;   **The Scout community provides power for sustainable development. Users can apply for Scout status in Discord after holding staking NFT. Users who with ID can initiate proposals for new strategies in Discord or Github, and users in the community can participate in voting and interaction . The team decides whether to deploy based on a review model. The discoverers will be rewarded once their strategies are adopted.**
